4px Font
========

An almost complete ascii font of 4 pixels wide.

![Preview](preview2_x4.png)  

This font set contains 90 out of 96 visible characters of the ASCII standard.

The tileset contains 95 tile of 4x4 px placed in the order of the ASCII 
standard (0x20 to 0x7e) so that is simple to access them.

Unfortunately, the chars `$`, `&`, `@`, `{` and `}` could not be drown because 
of the low resolution. All of them (except for `%` and `#`) fit in a 3x4 px 
space, plus 1 px for spacing.
